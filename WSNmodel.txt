Underlay TC:
First rule "inactivate":
Three nodes are actively connected with each other building a triangle.
The longest connection will be classified as inactive under certain circumstances.
Second rule "activate":
A unclassified connection between two nodes.
It will be actived when there is no other way between these nodes with certain condition, e.g. not more than 3 connections.

Underlay Environment:
First scenario:
Through environment changes we dont know the class of a connection.
It will be classified as unclassified.
Second scenario:
Two nodes which werent in range at first got in range through a change in environment.
A connection between these nodes will be created as unclassified.
Third scenario:
Two nodes which were in range at first got out of range through a change in environment.
A connection between these nodes will be destroyed.

Overlay TC:
This isnt defined yet.

Overlay Environment:
First scenario:
Need a connection between two nodes with certain condition which doesnt exist yet.
Add this connection.
Second scenario:
No need for a specific connection any more.
Remove this connection

Constrains:
All overlay connection must be realized in the underlay.
Tradeoff: Low network degree to reduce energy costs./High connectivity to ensure robustness.(Minimum/Maximum number of connections)

Constrains to discuss:
Low diameter to ensure low distance.
High bisection bandwith to ensure high throughput.
